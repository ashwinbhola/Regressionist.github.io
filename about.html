I’m a Research Engineer at Bloomberg with a strong foundation in machine learning and over five years of experience in the industry.
My professional journey has immersed me in the worlds of software design, systems architecture, and cutting-edge AI algorithms.
But beyond the code and data, I’m deeply fascinated by the human side of knowledge —- philosophy, psychology, and sociology.

This blog is my space to explore these seemingly diverse interests.
Whether it’s unpacking a technical concept, reflections on the ideas of great philosophers, or musings on consciousness and society, I write to learn, question, and share. 
If you're curious about how an engineering mind introspects about self and society, you're in the right place.
